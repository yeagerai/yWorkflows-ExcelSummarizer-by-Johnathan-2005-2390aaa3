# ExcelSummarizer

ExcelSummarizer is a Yeager Workflow that automates the process of extracting insights from an Excel workbook, analyzing formulas, and generating a summary report in the form of a Word document. The workflow consists of five key steps, which are as follows: 1) Accept an Excel workbook uploaded by the user. 2) Extract relevant data trends, patterns, and anomalies from the workbook using appropriate Excel APIs or data sources. 3) Generate a summary of the workbook using natural language processing or machine learning techniques, and create visual aids that highlight key insights. 4) Analyze all formulas used in the workbook and generate a detailed report on their purpose and function. 5) Generate a professional, readable Word document that summarizes the workbook and includes the detailed report on formulas used, a table of contents, and relevant visual aids.
